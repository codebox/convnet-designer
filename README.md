#  Convolutional Neural Network Designer

## TODO
* Show parameter count and memory usage once output layer has been added
* Dropdown for reasonable pooling values
* Hovering over layer in list should highlight layer in diagram
* Calculate zero-padding values for convolutions
* Validation
* Improve scaling (layer spacing does not change as number of layers increases)
* Fix fuzzy lines on canvas
* Generate Tensorflow code
* Remove colour info from network.js
* Shade colours in diagram
